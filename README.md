# Accelerate

TODO: Documentation

To read the Accelerate `1.0.0` documentation, go [see the `README`](https://github.com/calebmer/accelerate/blob/b3d3460f6c541c2089147ae149f20eaa29f48c67/README.md). Most of the concepts are the same, thereâ€™s just a completely different implementation.

Also run `accelerate --help` to see the commands.
